title: ClearML Session CLI
---

`clearml-session` is a feature that allows to launch a session of JupyterLab, VS Code, and SSH, and to execute code on a remote 
machine that better meets resource needs. This feature provides local links to access JupyterLab and VS Code on a 
remote machine over a secure and encrypted SSH connection. By default, the JupyterLab and 
VS Code remote sessions use ports 8878 and 8898 respectively.

## Prerequisites
* `clearml` installed and configured. See [ClearML Setup](../clearml_sdk/clearml_sdk_setup.md) for details.
* At least one `clearml-agent` running on a remote host. See [installation](../clearml_agent/clearml_agent_deployment_bare_metal.md#installation) for details.
* An SSH client installed on your machine. To verify, open your terminal and execute `ssh`. If you did not receive an 
error, you are good to go.

## Launching ClearML Session 
1. Install `clearml-session`: 

   ```commandline
   pip install clearml-session
   ```

1. Run `clearml-session`:

   ```commandline
   clearml-session 
   ```    

   You can add flags to set a container image, the remote SSH port, JupyterLab/VS Code versions, and more. See [CLI options](#command-line-options) 
   for all configuration options.  
   
   `clearml-session` creates a new [Task](../fundamentals/task.md) that is responsible for setting up the SSH and 
   JupyterLab/VS Code environment according to your specifications on the host machine. 
 
1. Follow the `clearml-session` setup wizard:
      
   1. `Select the queue` - Choose the queue where the ClearML Session task will be enqueued. The agent assigned to this queue
   will set up and launch the remote server.
   1. `Launch interactive session?` - Click `y` to launch the interactive session. 

1. The session Task is enqueued in the selected queue, and a ClearML Agent pulls and executes it. The agent downloads the appropriate IDE(s) and 
   launches it.  

1. Once the agent finishes the initial setup of the interactive Task, the local `clearml-session` connects to the host 
   machine via SSH, and tunnels both SSH and IDE over the SSH connection. If a container is specified, the 
   IDE environment runs inside of it. 
   
1. The CLI outputs access links to the remote JupyterLab and VS Code sessions:  

    ```console
    Interactive session is running:
    SSH: ssh root@localhost -p 8022 [password: <password>]
    Jupyter Lab URL: http://localhost:8878/?token=<token>
    VSCode server available at http://localhost:8898/
    ```

   Notice the links are to `localhost` since all communication to the remote server itself is done over a secure SSH connection.
   Click on the Jupyter Lab or VScode links, or drop into SSH shell by typing `shell`.

1. Now start working on the code as if you're running on the target machine itself!

## Re-launching and Shutting Down Sessions 
If a `clearml-session` was launched locally and is still running on a remote machine, you can easily reconnect to it.
To reconnect to a previous session, execute `clearml-session` with no additional flags, and the option of reconnecting 
to an existing session will show up: 

```console
Connect to active session id=c7302b564aa945408aaa40ac5c69399c [Y]/n?
```

If multiple sessions were launched from a local machine and are still active, choose the desired session:

```console
Active sessions:
0*] 2021-05-09 12:24:11 id=ed48fb83ad76430686b1abdbaa6eb1dd
1] 2021-05-09 12:06:48 id=009eb34abde74182a8be82f62af032ea
Connect to session [0-1] or 'N' to skip
```

To shut down a remote session, which frees the `clearml-agent` and closes the CLI, enter "Shutdown". If a session 
is shut down, there is no option to reconnect to it. 

## Connecting to an Existing Session
If a `clearml-session` is running remotely, you can continue working on the session from any machine. 
When `clearml-session` is launched, it initializes a task with a unique ID in the ClearML Server. 

To connect to an existing session: 
1. Go to the web UI, find the interactive session task (by default, it's in project "DevOps").
1. Copy the unique ID by clicking the `ID` button in the task page's header.
1. Run the following command: `clearml-session --attach <session_id>`.
1. Click on the JupyterLab / VS Code link that is outputted, or connect directly to the SSH session

## Features 
### Running in a Container
To run a session inside a container, use the `--docker` flag and enter the image to use in the interactive 
session.

### Kubernetes Support 
With ClearML k8s-glue you can enable launching ClearML sessions directly within Kubernetes pods. Set up the network and 
ingress settings for `clearml-session` in the `sessions` section of the [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/clearml/clearml-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/clearml-agent/values.yaml)
file. 

Make sure to set the following values:
* Set `portModeEnabled: true` to allow sessions to run directly from a pod  
* `svcType` - Set the service type to either `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`. Note that if set to `NodePort`, the 
`externalIP` must be set to the IP of one of the workers. If set to `LoadBalancer`, you need to have a LoadBalancer and 
external IP address set up in advance, before applying the chart
* `externalIP` - Define an external IP address that the client will connect to. Note that this external IP needs to be 
set up in advance.
* `maxServices` - The maximum number of sessions the agent will spawn

For example: 
```
# -- Sessions internal service configuration
sessions:
  # -- Enable/Disable sessions portmode WARNING: only one Agent deployment can have this set to true
  portModeEnabled: true
  # -- specific annotations for session services
  svcAnnotations: {}
  # -- service type ("NodePort" or "ClusterIP" or "LoadBalancer")
  svcType: "NodePort"
  # -- External IP sessions clients can connect to
  externalIP: 0.0.0.0
  # -- starting range of exposed NodePorts
  startingPort: 30000
  # -- maximum number of NodePorts exposed
  maxServices: 20
```

For more information, see [Kubernetes](../clearml_agent/clearml_agent_deployment_k8s.md).


### Installing Requirements
`clearml-session` can install required Python packages when setting up the remote environment. 
Specify requirements in one of the following ways: 
* Attach a `requirement.txt` file to the command using `--requirements </file/location.txt>`.
* Manually specify packages using `--packages "<package_name>"` 
(for example `--packages "keras" "clearml"`), and they'll be automatically installed.

### Accessing a Git Repository
To access a git repository remotely, add a `--git-credentials` flag and set it to `true`, so the local `.git-credentials` 
file is sent to the interactive session. This is helpful if working on private git repositories, and it allows for seamless 
cloning and tracking of git references, including untracked changes. 

### Uploading Local Files to Remote Session
You can upload local files and directories from your local machine into the remote session by specifying their path with 
`--upload-files <file_path>`. The entire content of the directory or file will be copied into your remote 
`clearml-session` container under the `~/session-files/` directory.

```commandline
clearml-session --upload-files /mnt/data/stuff
```

You can upload your files in conjunction with the `--store-workspace` option to easily move workloads between local 
development machines and remote machines with persistent workspace synchronization. See [Storing and Synchronizing Workspace](#storing-and-synchronizing-workspace).

### Starting a Debugging Session
You can debug previously executed tasks registered in the ClearML system on a remote interactive session. 
Input into `clearml-session` the ID of a Task to debug, then `clearml-session` clones the task's git repository and 
replicates the environment on a remote machine. Then the code can be interactively executed and debugged on JupyterLab / VS Code. 

:::note
The Task must be connected to a git repository, since currently single script debugging is not supported.
:::

1. In the **ClearML web UI**, find the task that needs debugging.
1. Copy the unique ID by clicking the `ID` button in the task page's header.
1. Enter the following command: `clearml-session --debugging-session <task_id>`
1. Click on the JupyterLab / VS Code link, or connect directly to the SSH session.
1. In JupyterLab / VS Code, access the task's repository in the `environment/task_repository` folder. 

### Storing and Synchronizing Workspace
You can store and sync your interactive session workspace with the `--store-workspace` option. `clearml-session`
will automatically create a snapshot of your entire workspace when shutting it down, and later restore in a 
new session on any remote machine. 

Specify the remote workspace root-folder by adding `--store-workspace <workspace_root_folder>` to the command line. In 
the remote session container, put all your code and data under the `<workspace_root_folder>` directory. When your 
session is shut down, the workspace folder will be automatically packaged and stored on the ClearML file server. 

```commandline
clearml-session --store-workspace ~/workspace
```

In your next `clearml-session` execution, specify `--store-workspace <workspace_root_folder>` again and `clearml-session` 
will grab the previous workspace snapshot and restore it into the new remote container in `<workspace_root_folder>`.

```commandline
clearml-session --store-workspace ~/workspace
```

To continue a specific session and restore its workspace, specify the session ID with `--continue-session <session_id>`:

```commandline
clearml-session --continue-session <session_id> --store-workspace ~/workspace 
```
